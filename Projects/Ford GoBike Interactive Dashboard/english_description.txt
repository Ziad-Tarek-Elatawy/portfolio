I have developed an end-to-end Interactive Dashboard to analyze and visualize the Ford GoBike urban mobility data. I built this project entirely in Python using Plotly and Dash, transforming raw trip data into a dynamic, professional, and user-friendly web application.

Key achievements and features I implemented:
- Developed dynamic KPIs for real-time tracking of Total Trips, Average Trip Duration, Total Subscribers, and Active Stations.
- Designed interactive temporal charts showing trips by weekday and hour to precisely identify peak commuting trends.
- Analyzed user behavior by creating clear visual comparisons between Subscribers and Regular Customers, broken down by gender, to understand user demographics.
- Executed geographic station analysis to visually highlight the most popular starting stations for optimized bike distribution.
- Programmed a sleek sidebar equipped with dynamic filters, allowing users to effortlessly slice and dice the data based on their needs.

I also handled the complete data lifecycle, from data cleaning and feature engineering (e.g., calculating trip duration in minutes and creating age groups) to designing a scalable, production-ready UI architecture with reusable components.

This project demonstrates my deep expertise in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and building Interactive Web Applications, proving my ability to turn complex datasets into strategic, impactful business tools.
